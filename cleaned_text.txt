cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him . thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him . even while suffering the trip to his home , cook swore to moore and lane that he would kill the indian . three weeks later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , cook and russell rode to arrest martinez . arriving at daybreak , they found julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender . instead , he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , cook reported . both cook's and russell's lives were threatened by the mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion . general manager pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished . on february 17 , russell and cook were sent to the pena flor community on the vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased . while talking with julian m. beall , francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away . it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and began riding down the stream . they had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them . suspecting an ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill . after spending two nights  wednesday and thursday  in catskill , the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business . they stayed with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock saturday morning passed the old garnett lee ranch . half a mile below at the mouth of salyer's canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from a. j. armstrong , occupied by a mexican , his wife , and an old trapper . there were three houses in salyer's canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , thence to the vermejo . to the west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub oak and other brush . as they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers . not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing on through his body . with the first reports , russell's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of salyer's canyon immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse fell . grabbing his winchester from its sheath , cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank . bullets were so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire . noticing russell's horse in front of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him . at a very shallow place , two mexicans rushed into the open for a shot . dropping to one knee , cook felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade , sending no further fire in his direction . just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house . russell had reached the house as cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper's arms -- dead . a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head , tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side . finding him dead , cook caught russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins . before daylight sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of deputy sheriff frank macpherson of catskill followed the trail to the house of francisco chaves , where 100 to 150 mexicans had gathered . macpherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance . the men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid . the officer demanded the names of the injured men ; ; the mexicans not only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it . since the strength of the mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants , macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw . the posse's retreat encouraged the mexicans to be overbearing and impudent . during the following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by bonito lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and pedro chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed ; ; and a store was broken into and robbed . district attorney m. w. mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms -- he just did not catch anyone . increasing threats on his life finally convinced cook that he should leave new mexico . his friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles . by early summer , he wrote from laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially , so pels sent him a draft for 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return . pels also sent a check for 100 to russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave . cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position . they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot . and the law virtually ignored the situation . the judge became ill just as the colfax district court convened , no substitute was brought in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks . pels complained :  litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; ; public money spent ; ; justice delayed ; ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' . word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was manuel gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him . although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served . on may 19 , a deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left maxwell city and rode thirty-five miles up the vermejo where they were joined by juan jose martinez . by 3:00 a.m. they reached his house and found it vacant . when they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room . still there was no gonzales and the family would say nothing . about 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square . while prowling around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside . he was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door . the posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive . again he refused . in deadly earnest , the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside , only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor . when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a winchester . shot near the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him . as he pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside . not realizing the seriousness of the wound , the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him . receiving no answer , they set the fire . when the house was about half consumed , his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands , declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of manuel . finding it true that he was not inside , the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket . several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand . shot six or eight times the body was draped with russell's pistol , belt , and cartridges . there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who , though numbering in the fifties , had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack . early the next morning , a mexican telephoned pels that celso chavez , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten mexicans at his father's home on the upper vermejo . the sheriff and district attorney mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by chavez and dr. i. p. george , and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman . traveling all night , clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock may 22 . occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse's approach . a mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against chavez for taking part in the  murder '' of manuel gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger . the men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along with three other families desiring to leave . the ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large , and pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses , defending themselves through loopholes , it would be most difficult to capture them . thus he wired j. p. lower and sons of denver :  have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot ? ? if not , how long to order and what is the price '' ? ? he wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the mexicans were on their guard . his problem then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean out the vermejo by force immediately .

how else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium  section 381c9  , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization  section 381c16  , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation  section 381c6  , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company  section 381c14  , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes ? ? these items , and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381 . there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities . with respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381c , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation . to this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute . it is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes . such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of congress as expressed in the committee report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the united states code . refund claims section 203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a claim against the government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued . if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381a . a clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation . the leading case , seaboard air line railway v. united states , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed . the court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly tenuous claims , against the government . neither reason , said the court , applied to the case at hand ; ; furthermore , congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states . other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors , corporate dissolutions , transfers by descent , or transfers by subrogation . exceptions are often classified as transfers by  operation of law '' . a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an  operation of law '' mold . although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash , to which section 203 quite clearly applies , the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund of taxes paid by transferors . a recent case in point is mitchell canneries v. united states , in which a claim against the government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners . holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the court cited the seaboard , novo trading , and roomberg cases for the proposition that  transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute '' . in an earlier case , kingan  co. v. united states , an american corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british corporation . the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british corporation . the transaction presumably would have qualified under section 368a1 as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , but not under section 368a1 as a statutory merger of consolidation . the court , nevertheless , relied on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same . in substance , said the court , there was no transfer of equitable title . the treasury arrives at substantially the same conclusion , but skirts the problem of section 203 of the united states code . revenue ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation . proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed . if the succession is a matter of public record , certificates of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody of the documents will suffice ; ; if the succession is not of record , all documents relating to such succession , properly certified , are required . the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation , the latter to a contractual acquisition . the ruling would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash . a recent ruling , although rather confusing , cites and follows rev. rul. 54-17 . the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization . hence , a successor corporation in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section 203 . in a b reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , those cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor . in fact , a cash purchase of a corporation's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step . these results appear sound . as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis . the cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed . the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381a , which is the only type presently under discussion . section 381a applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent , a statutory merger or consolidation , an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization . in virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated , and its former stockholders either own outright , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax . in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote . furthermore , in a c reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly inapplicable . nor is it at all likely that a  desperate '' claim against the government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization . if the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes . if such an unlikely transaction were to take place , it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary , followed by liquidation . in the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock . it appears , then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381c , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381a is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation . section 203 of the united states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the government transferred in tax-free reorganizations . the successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims . other tax attributes of the transferor there are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved . for example , property  used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section 1231 , presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation . the parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368a1 , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file consolidated returns with its own subsidiaries . similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting  section 381c4  or depreciation  section 381c6  . other sections of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization . section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property transferred , and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee . section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period . however , a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for a person acquiring emergency facilities . attributes similar to a loss carryover . there may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items . for example , suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits credits . this carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover . it is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income ; ; it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax . under the 1939 code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton brewery case , but only over the dissent of judge learned hand , who wrote the majority opinion in the sansome case , a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization . since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have . with respect to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the committee report , quoted above , which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein . actually , there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover . probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax avoidance .

for a wave offering before the lord, with the two lambs: they shall be
men need unity and they need god . care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands . the statement also points to a classic paradox : the more men turn toward god , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another . to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human race . massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender . the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind :  oh how we hate one another for the love of god '' ! ! the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify . it lies in institutions . institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion . a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ; ; to escape this fate , it must rule some things out . for every criterion which defines what something is , at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not . some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ; ; in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense with churches . the suggestion is naive . man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being . having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance . to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools . both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible . as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him . yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows . is there any way out of the predicament ? ? the only way that i can see is through communication . interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries . approached creatively , it is a high art . it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart god's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary . in a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states . what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ? i shall touch on three areas : personal , national , and theological . 1  by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure . some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate . such needs may rise to pathological proportions . modern psychology has shown that paralleling  the authoritarian personality '' is  the bigoted personality '' in which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally . fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us . to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us . interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever . it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies . 2  while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable . the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century . emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires . no less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 , , and the number is growing by the year . as an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between christians and non-christians in these lands . colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious , for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other . actually , however , this turns out to be only part of the picture . nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries . the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need . insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's . all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand . africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda . the people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of course , christians on the mainland of china . but the problem extends elsewhere . for example , in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion . in 1960 ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly christian -- schools , to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 roman catholics . again , india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone . the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo . i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists' world radio program . he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them . after returning to the united states and raising the money , he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available . it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; ; they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes . it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment . ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since world war 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs . although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves . the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims ; ; neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews . 3  i turn finally to several theological developments . 1 . theocracy reconsidered . the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form . the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof '' . one of our foremost jurists , david dudley field , has gone so far as to call this provision  the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history '' . the trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment . pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a muslim state , but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation .  what is the point '' , charles adams reports the pakistanis as asking ,  in demanding an islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is '' ? ? the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular . and while the nation was formerly named  the islamic republic of pakistan '' , it is now simply  the republic of pakistan '' . comparable trends can be noted elsewhere . the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor . the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months . during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties . now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise . and in this country gustave weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state . the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigel's theological argument . everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word , too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine . 2 . salvation reconsidered . my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them . that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed . i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit . leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says ,  we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it '' . newbiggin's qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance . the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests , father feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church . in mentioning this under  salvation reconsidered '' i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is .

if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music . much of this lifelike quality results from mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections . in this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as monteverdi , lully and purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages . through long experimentation in his songs , mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different from others as the language itself . giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words . the moments of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants . otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- boris' first monologue , for example . even then , the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance . aside from boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture . even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision . consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action : pimen , varlaam , missail and the jesuit rangoni . under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; each musical setting has an individual touch . pimen is an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full forte -- but firm and clear of mind . his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement . a quiet but sturdy theme , somewhat folklike in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life : this theme comes to represent the outer world , the realm of battles and banquets -- seen from a distance , quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery . it changes and develops according to the text ; ; it introduces pimen when he comes before boris in the last act . once he has been identified , however , a new melody is used to accompany his narrative , a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect : an imaginative storyteller , pimen takes on the character he describes , as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure . here the composer uses a favorite device of his , the intensification of the mood through key relationships . the original d minor seems to symbolize blindness , inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it . as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream , light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear , and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major . varlaam and missail always appear together and often sing together , in a straightforward , rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated pimen . their begging song might easily be a folk melody : the same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene . apparently their origin is humble , their approach to life direct and unsophisticated . whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now . missail is the straight man , not very talkative , mild-mannered when he does speak . varlaam is loud , rowdy , uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same . a rough ostinato figure , heard first in the introduction to the inn scene , characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action : the song of kazan , in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment , fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits . the phrasing is irregular , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness .  we can imagine how they startled audiences of the 1870's .  varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine , but he pulls himself together when the need arises . both monks respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song ; ; a clever naturalistic touch is varlaam's labored reading of the warrant . as the knack gradually comes back to him , his rhythm becomes steadier , with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader . for the only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural inflection ; ; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene . musically and dramatically , rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as varlaam . his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's hoffman . his speech shows none of the native accent of the russian characters ; ; in spite of the italian name , he sounds french . his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina , who is -- perhaps purposely -- rather superficially characterized . rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it . the effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere . he speaks quietly , concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility , just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them . he addresses marina with great deference , calling her  princess '' at first ; ; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name , placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father . curiously , this scene is a close parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time , the scene between amonasro and aida . rangoni and amonasro have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause -- and their tactics are much the same . rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the church ; ; this brings a reaction of distress from marina . the music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics . as if in a trance , she repeats his words -- then realizes , with a shock , her own audacity . this is no assignment for a frivolous girl , she assures him . now rangoni comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power . it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's gesture , with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness . another theme , sinuously chromatic , appears as he directs her to gain power over grigori by any means , even at the cost of her honor . coming from a priest , the music sounds as odd as the advice : marina rebels at this suggestion . her pride is as much at stake as her virtue ; ; she is the unattainable beauty , the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen . indignantly she denounces rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her . at once the jesuit pulls out all the stops . to music of a menacing darkness , he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl , poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty . the combined threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her , and she falls terrified at his feet . with another sudden change of mood , he is again calm and protective , exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman -- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction . whatever the source of rangoni's power , marina is his captive now ; ; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet , again throwing a chill over the atmosphere . the most unusual feature of boris , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the chorus . this is the real protagonist of the drama ; ; the conflict is not boris versus grigori or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child , but boris versus the russian people . mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action . boris' first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene , with its dazzling confusion of tonalities . we have a brief glimpse of the tsar's public personality , the  official boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene , its bitter resentment and fury in the final act . one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression . it rarely speaks as a unit . even in its most conventional appearance , the guests' song of praise to marina , there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness . in many passages -- for example , the council of boyars -- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion . hot arguments arise between tenors and basses , who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea . the opening scene shows this method at its most individual . mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people , those who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without understanding the causes . they are held in control by force , but barely . they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely intense song , its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath , but when the police with their cudgels move away , they mock and grumble and fight among themselves . there is a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone .  hey , mityukh '' , asks one group ,  what are we shouting about '' ? ? and mityukh , apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion . the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return ; ; then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before , ending it with a wail of despair . mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force . in pimen's cell the soft prayers of the monks , heard from offstage , not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori's thoughts and his situation . this is especially striking between pimen's quiet exit and grigori's vehement outburst against boris . again , as boris feels himself nearing death , a procession files into the hall singing a hymn , its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere : the words are hardly calculated to put the tsar's mind at ease . they echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who  trembles and begs for mercy -- and there is no mercy '' . the living as well as the dead now accuse him ; ; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one . one of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the st. basil's scene , usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score . though brief , it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy . in addition , it is an important link in the plot , giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward boris and the false dimitri . the mayhem in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel . the st. basil's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny . in the orchestra we hear first a hushed , hesitant pizzicato figure , then the insistent  police '' motif as it appeared in the opening scene . the service is over , and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman mityukh in the lead . they bring the news that the pretender has been excommunicated ; ; this is met with scorn by the hearers , who claim that mityukh is lying or drunk .  mussorgsky cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment , solemn chords or mocking staccatos .  there is still more news , mityukh announces : they have prayed for the soul of the tsarevich .

important as was mr. o'donnell's essay , his thesis is so restricting as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has . he and also mr. cowley and mr. warren have fallen to the temptation which besets many of us to read into our authors -- nathaniel hawthorne , for example , and herman melville -- protests against modernism , material progress , and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs . faulkner's total works today , and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr. cowley made his comment , or in 1939 , when mr. o'donnell wrote his essay , reveal no such simple attitude toward the south . if he is a traditionalist , he is an eclectic traditionalist . if he condemns the recent or the present , he condemns the past with no less force . if he sees the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen , he sees also -- and he shows -- the blind and the mean , and he sees the compson family disintegrating from within . if the barn-burner's family produces a flem snopes , who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness , the compson family produces a jason compson 4 . faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist . others writing on faulkner have found the phrase  traditional moralist '' either inadequate or misleading . among them are frederick j. hoffman , william van o'connor , and mrs. olga vickery . they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , i believe , in pointing out faulkner's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition . faulkner's is not the mind of the apologist which mr. o'donnell implies that it is . he is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social , cultural , or literary traditions than he was within the traditions -- or possibly the regulations -- governing his tenure in the post office at oxford , mississippi , thirty-five years ago . that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books . it is to say rather , i believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique . he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern . the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern , i rather think , for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity . some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation , either mental or physical , are particularly southern traits . there is no necessity , i suppose , to assert that mr. faulkner is southern . it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family . and , after all , he has lived comfortably at both oxford , mississippi , and charlottesville , virginia . the young william faulkner in new orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist hamilton basso as obviously conscious of being a southerner , and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so . besides showing no inclination , apparently , to absent himself from his native region even for short periods , and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region , he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years . it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge . his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south , implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation . his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south . to believe otherwise would be unrealistic . but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south , it is important not to lose the broader perspective . his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers . evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers , who deal in extravagant horror , to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists , henry james and james joyce among them . his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach , but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him . my intention , therefore , is not to say that faulkner's awareness has been confined within the borders of the south , but rather that he has looked at his world as a southerner and that presumably his outlook is southern . the ingredients of faulkner's novels and stories are by no means new with him , and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him . a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made , i think , by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region . the planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy published swallow-barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of frank meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature . the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come , however , until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed . as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed . their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south , even while memories of the war were still sharp . the tradition reached its apex , perhaps , in the works of thomas nelson page toward the end of the century , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel so red the rose , by stark young . although faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition , he did not have stark young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society . the myth of the southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality , as francis pendleton gaines showed forty years ago , and i suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed . faulkner has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook . without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the sartoris and the compson families faulkner's chief concern is social criticism , we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the civil war . it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard , for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow , who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society . faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life . they have an ancestry extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when william byrd described the lubberlanders he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina . the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the realistic , humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war . these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of horace , mr. addison , mr. pope , and sir walter scott . there is evidence to suggest , in fact , that many authors of the humorous sketches were prompted to write them -- or to make them as indelicate as they are -- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements which had come to dominate the polite letters of the south . william gilmore simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him . simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully . augustus baldwin longstreet , a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states , published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character ransy sniffle , in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat , and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters , he set an example followed by many after him . others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas bangs thorpe , creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen , the bee-hunter ; ; johnson jones hooper , whose character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will ; ; and george washington harris , whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature . it would be profitable , i believe , to read these realistic humorists alongside faulkner's works , the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time , to faulkner's time . such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent . such characters , with their low existence and often low morality , produce humorous effects in his novels and tales , as they did in the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers ; ; nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters . one of the early humorists already mentioned , thomas bangs thorpe , can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials . thorpe came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty . but thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence , the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements , and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions . as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble , arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; ; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor ,  the big bear of arkansas '' , in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature .

but , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century a.d. , when an arabic scholar , tabit ibn korra  836-901  is said to have discussed the magic square of three . thus , while it remains possible that the babylonians andor the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years . 2 . the  lo shu '' square as an expression of centrality the concept of the middle kingdom at peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the warring states , was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the ch'in dynasty  221-207 b.c.  . but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism . among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor , shih huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 b.c. , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking ; ; but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared . many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast ch'in palace some ten years later ; ; yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period  from 202 b.c. to a.d. 220  . in fact , during the first century b.c. , an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called  wei books '' , a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination . however , the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 . after all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu , which was already semisecret anyhow . but , in spite of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the han period . although modern scholars have expressed surprise that  the simple magic square of three '' , a mere  mathematical puzzle '' , was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself . but , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts . such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the lo shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram . the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it . indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram . if one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3  the base number of the magic square of three  , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals . then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9  which is the square of the base number  , the result is 45 ; ; and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed . furthermore , the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ; it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 . in fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese . for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature ; ; and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd  yang  numbers , and those composed of large and small even  yin  numbers , were all equal to each other . thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis . the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality . these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty . the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century b.c. , when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences . his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy . after this time , inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest . later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally . all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b.c. , also may conceivably have led to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five . we find , for example , such groupings as the five ancient rulers , the five sacred mountains , the five directions  with center  , the five metals , five colors , five tastes , five odors , five musical notes , five bodily functions , five viscera , and many others . this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; ; but why did the old chinese postulate five elements , when the ancient near east -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four ? ? and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ? obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives , and that may have been the workings of the lo shu . this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking . whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought . scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries . 3 . yin and yang in the  lo shu '' square although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it , might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders . for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time . as such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu ; ; but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it . the chinese world view during the han dynasty , when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school , which was traditionally founded by tsou yen . according to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by heaven , t'ien -- as a natural force , or in the personification of a supreme sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the tao , which can be roughly interpreted as  the order of the universe '' or  the universal way '' . heaven , acting through the tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles , the yin and the yang . the yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the sun ; ; while the yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the moon . together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything . we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang , while the even numbers were yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center . during the han dynasty , another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu , considering the latter as a plan of ancient china . instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , yang numbers with mountains  firm and resistant , hence yang  and the even numbers with rivers  sinuous and yielding , hence yin  ; ; taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china . thus the middle number , 5 , represented sung-shan in honan , central china ; ; the 3 , t'ai-shan in shantung , east china ; ; the 7 , hwa-shan in shensi , west china ; ; the 1 , heng-shan in hopei , north china  or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi  ; ; and the 9 , huo-shan in anhwei , which was then the south sacred mountain . for the rivers , the 4 represented the huai , to the  then  southeast ; ; the 2 , the san kiang  three rivers  in the  then  southwest ; ; the 8 , the chi in the northeast ; ; and the 6 , the  upper  yellow river in the northwest . note that by western standards this plan was  upside down '' , as it put north at the bottom and south at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered ; ; but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps . the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces ; ; and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in this same fashion .

for several months now , jack carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a woman . this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately . when she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach . then he would run to the toilet behind the house . sometimes he did this three or four times a day , for this woman was almost always with him . he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him . but they never said anything , so he figured it was all right . and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room chestnut school , where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the woman of jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure . he could not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do . when he awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh . miss langford  her first name was evelyn  was an attractive girl . tall , blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress . something was beginning to stir and come alive in her , too  it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear  : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like jack . she would look at jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and jack would see the woman and become breathless and a little sick . school began in august , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days miss langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another . the first two or three days they went home early . all , that is , except jack . he hung around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order . once  this was on the third day of school  she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg . he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating . about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she did not even see him . he jumped back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school . he did not look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; then he slowed to a walk . the vision became even stronger now .  i will get her yet '' , he muttered to himself .  i have got to get her '' . that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act  and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality  , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire . he ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .  what is the matter , honey '' ? ? she said , with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child .  aren't you hungry '' ? ?  no , i am not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs . outside it was already hot at 7:30 a.m. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen . he felt a little sick at his stomach .  are you sick '' ? ?  no '' , he said .  i will be all right . i guess it is this hot weather '' .  do not you play hard today then . and if you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early . daddy left the car for me , and i am going to town this afternoon '' .  ok. , i will not play hard '' , he promised . just then charles lever yelled ,  hey , jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house , and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling  good-bye , mom '' over his shoulder .  whaddya say , boy '' ? ? charles said , grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth . charles , also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes . he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him .  you know what i done last night '' ? ? charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the dixie highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school . jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were charles' only apparent interest . but jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from charles' revelations  even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention  , so he usually invited them , as he did now .  no . what '' ? ?  i got margaret rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry '' . a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind . his heart beat faster .  hell you say '' ? ? he said , lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles .  how'd you do it '' ? ?  hell , i jist got on top of -- ''  no , i mean how'd you get her to do it '' ? ?  hell , i jist ask her '' .  jist like that '' ? ?  hell , yes . she's been hangin' around me a lot here lately , and i figgered i might as well's try it . besides i heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it '' .  i never heard that '' .  it is all over branchville . if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself '' .  i might try it one of these days '' , jack said wonderingly , thinking of miss langford . when they reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing  crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse . miss langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .  time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .  let's go inside '' .  oh , come on miss langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully .  no , not now '' , said the teacher .  maybe at dinner time . come inside now '' . the children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse . jack watched miss langford all morning . he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about margaret rider . occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did . at noontime , remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except charles , went off out the road to play ball .  why am not you playin' ball '' ? ? he asked charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse .  miss langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .  i had druther stay here and watch the girls '' , charles grinned .  maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .  maybe '' , jack said idly , watching for miss langford . presently she came out of the schoolhouse . when she appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling ,  goody , goody '' .  let's play with 'em '' , jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .  o.k. '' charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls . they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap . then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls , jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head . while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , jack ran over , offered her his hand and said ,  gosh , i am sorry , miss langford . i did not mean to pull so hard '' .  that's all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes .  it was my fault '' . with one hand she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with the other . when her hand touched his , fire went through jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet . he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .  thank you '' , she said , dusting herself off .  will you play with us again , miss langford '' ? ? one of the little girls said .  no more today . maybe some other day '' .  oh , shucks '' , the girl said .  i do not believe i will play any more neither '' .  me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone . jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past robert allen's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes . when he came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up . he simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class . that should do it , he thought , because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work . he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school . the only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack .  but i have got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately . to his surprise his plan worked perfectly .  all right , if you cannot do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , miss langford said firmly , not smiling .  you will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' . and so when the others stampeded out that afternoon jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home . he scarcely saw them . his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child ,  how will i do it ? ?

when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to  permit '' the termination of the human race by human action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean . of course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows . yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action . i mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by  permit '' . he is not talking in the main about probabilities , risks and danger in general . he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing  and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result  as it efficaciously does some good . he is talking about double effects , of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; ; of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences . this is what , in a technical sense , to  only permit '' an evil result means . it means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends . of course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good  permits '' , in this sense , the termination of the human race by human action . certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives ,  it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative '' . naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken into account . especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited . presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account . there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm . if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good  or lesser evil  that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil . nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences . he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action . above all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction . he does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on the other hand , as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not  permit '' in the sense explained . by contrast , a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; ; and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone's doing or by accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based . mr. philip toynbee writes , for example , that  in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues . if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin '' . against such a termination of human life on earth by human action , he then proposes as an alternative that we  negotiate at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available '' , that we deliberately  negotiate from comparative weakness '' . he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i.e. , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by russia within a few years . this would be by far the better choice , when  it is a question of allowing the human race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish '' . nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is  a possible result , however improbable '' ; ;  the worst , and least probable '' result ; ;  if it did not prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing '' ; ; for  surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' . if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following  simple test '' :  have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are '' ? ? thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ; it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done . several of the replies to mr. toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil .  it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation '' .  i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by accident ' rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design . but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced ''  by precautions against accidents or by limiting war ? ?   quoting mr. kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he  toynbee  says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war '' .  if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter '' .  if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , i think he is right . i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war '' . even professor arnold toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms :  compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race , all other evils are lesser evils . let us therefore put first things first , and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be '' . mr. philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eighty-four , if he believed communism was not only evil but  also irredeemably evil '' , then he might  think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world . even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday '' . no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature . but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force . on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation . not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand . toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment .  i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation '' . would such an act of refusal be useful ? ? he does not mean , in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that  if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender '' . he wants to be  brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far , far more hopeless than was the hungarian revolution of 1956 '' . this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons . it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in the past .  it is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples . hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop '' . this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; ; it is to stride along the steep slope downward . the only contrary action , in the future as in the past , runs the risk of war ; ; and , now and in the future unlike in the past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will , by human action , render this planet less habitable by the human race . that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to  permitted '' effects , and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures . finally , just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing , by human action , to accelerate this end . we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future .

 she says she has to finish a story '' . he shrugged .  i asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go '' . casey made some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man . his name was george needham and he , too , had come from a good family . he was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave . he was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university . an only child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke . since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling . all this went through casey's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all . for he had understood that betty had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins . she had grown up with young jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice . he wanted to ask her about jenkins now , but he knew he couldn't do so in needham's presence . and so , still wondering and a little perplexed , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding .  where did you pick him up '' ? ?  oh , i have known him quite a while '' . she glanced at her companion fondly .  have not i , george '' ? ?  i have been after her for years '' , needham said ,  but i have never been able to get anywhere until the last few days '' . the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched casey's hand .  can i tell you a secret ? ? we're going to get married . do you approve '' ? ? casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl . he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from betty's estate to subsidize him . none of this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand . he made a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor .  i will have to give it some thought '' , he said .  you wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable , would you '' ? ? she made a face at him and then she laughed .  of course not '' .  i will get my references in order '' , needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused .  stop by any time , casey '' . he stood up and touched the girl's arm .  come on , darling . if you're really serious about working on that story , i had better take you home '' . casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check . as he went out he told freddie the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-cent piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry . a taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment . because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's car was still there . in fact , he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him . only then , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem . even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton , the pillow , the sheet of paper on top of it . then he was striding across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note . jack : look in the wastebasket . i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum , but it was a good try , kid , and i appreciate it . the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened . the discarded papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct . he put the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof . for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself . for another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications jarred him . it no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him . the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket . and that gun was empty . even before his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver . he considered them with brooding eyes , brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution . he said :  the crazy fool '' , half aloud . he put the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them . he thought : where the hell could he have gone ? ? how can i find him ? ? there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control . he tried to tell himself that maybe burton had sobered up enough to get some sense . maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough . he thought of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton . then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly .  yeah '' , he said .  casey '' ? ?  yeah '' .  tony calenda '' . casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head . when he heard calenda say :  what about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? ? it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for frank ackerly .  what picture '' ? ? he demanded .  you took a picture of me at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon '' .  who says so '' ? ?  one of my boys '' . casey believed that much . calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his  boys '' close at hand .  so '' ? ?  with my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that picture published '' .  who says it is going to be published '' ? ?  i wouldn't even want it to get around '' . under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken . even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly . right now , however , he was still too worried about jerry burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story burton had told him , to care too much about tony calenda . his nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice .  look '' , he said .  i was hired to take a picture . i took it . that's all i know about it and that's all i care '' .  maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said '' .  you tell him '' .  all right '' , calenda said , his voice still quiet .  but i meant what i said , casey . if that picture gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it , i am going to send a couple of my boys around to see you '' .  you do that '' , casey said .  just be sure to send your two best boys , tony '' . he hung up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create . as soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burton's home number . he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up . he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton up that afternoon . when he was told that no one had seen burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities . each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up . by the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down . he had done all he could and that was that . and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk . he , casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible . he should have stayed here and watched burton . he did not . so he made a mistake . so what ? ? he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink . only then did he decide he did not want one . he considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too . finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes . he had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again . when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent .  casey ? ? you do not know me but i know you . if you want a picture get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can . if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys '' . casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision . for over the years he had received many such calls . some of them came from people who identified themselves . some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past . others because they expected some sort of reward for the information . a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break . only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time . he was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from columbus avenue . it was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes . he did not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned . the police car had pulled up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on .

early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions . and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat record . every plane that could fly was sent into the air . cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan . anything the enemy flew or floated was his target . fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships . greg himself took two flights , with todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around ormoc on the east coast of leyte . each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs . a weapons carrier took greg , todman , belton , banjo ferguson , and walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip . it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes . no one had much to say . the sky glowered down at them . there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever . the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle . donovan snatched greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it . his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot . greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before . but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .  i have got her as neat as i can '' , donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the seton harness over greg's shoulders .  but this goddamn climate . it is for carabao not airplanes '' .  we'll make out . do not you worry , chief '' , greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it .  yeah . see you '' , donovan said as he jumped off the wing . the expression was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return . at the prearranged time , greg started the engine and taxied out . from the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip . he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission . yet long before the scheduled time for return , donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky . greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him . the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful . the pilots' heads looked ridiculously small . the control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan . greg's mission was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again . to the west , the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes . underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray . water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers . the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it . he possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory . he shivered in the warm cockpit . the overcast was solid above him . as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it . they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar and hope that it did not close in before they returned . greg pushed the radio button on his throttle .  todman , let's try to go under this stuff . stay in close and we'll go up the valley '' .  roger , sweeney '' , todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above greg . greg took the formation wide around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf . he dropped down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain . the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn . it was only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia . the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in . if the other pilots were worried , they did not show it . the formation remained perfect . when the sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out . he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast . although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity . once todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him .  somebody beat us to it '' ! ! todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation . visibility continued to be limited , and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet . it was frustrating . his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights . he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill . but greg's area remained as placid as a florida dawn . finally , as time began to run out , he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies . the low clouds made bombing difficult . there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run . the accuracy was deplorable . one of greg's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it . only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle . with their load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily . greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home . mercifully , it was still open . like a man making a deep dive , greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley . he was about to make a gas check on his flight when todman's voice broke in :  sweeneys ! ! three bogies . twelve o'clock level '' . greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel . he saw them , specks against the gray , but closing fast . they were headed straight for each other on a collision course . friend or enemy ? ? the same old question . and only a few seconds to answer it .  zeros '' ! ! todman said excitedly , and hopefully . and then he thought todman might be right . his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification . he narrowed the shape down to two : either a zero or a u. s. navy type aircraft . if it were the enemy , tactically his position was correct . japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , american on speed and firepower . his present maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages . but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already . but the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course . in seconds , greg made his decision . he pushed the radio button .  sweeney blue , hit the deck . lots of throttle . todman , you take the one on the left . i will take the middle . belton , the one on the right . if they're japs . let's make sure first '' . greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two  rogers '' . the planes , light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully . greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees . the opposing aircraft continued to come on . they appeared to be the enemy . greg wished the air corps had continued to camouflage planes . there was , of course , no way for the other planes to get by them . it was a box . but they could turn and escape to the east . greg pushed the radio button again .  todman , drop your second element back . if any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces . now let's make sure they're japs '' . even as he said it , greg knew they had found the enemy . the shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom . greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight . the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him . his hands shook .  arm your guns , sweeneys '' .  they're japs . they're japs '' , came a high-pitched voice .  greg to sweeney blue . one pass only . no turns . you will bust your ass in this canyon . that's an order '' . he moved the flights over against one wall . it gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery . if the turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out . a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done . greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting . the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around .  they have not seen us '' , greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .  they have not seen us '' . he hit the radio button .  now , sweeneys , now . let's take 'em home '' . he hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag . out of the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him . perfect , he thought . with the rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done . just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board . he tightened his turn . his nose up . it was going to be dangerous . eight aircraft in this small box . please , dear god , make my pilots good , he prayed . he took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another . the enemy did not veer . it did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted . blind fools . now ! ! greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger . the plane rumbled and slowed . six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished . as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them . greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered . luck was with him . his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane . the jap's propeller flew off in pieces . a large piece of engine cowling vanished . it was all greg had time to see . his maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds . his speed was dropping rapidly . if he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground . wingman , stay clear , he prayed . he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back . he fought the panic of vertigo . he had no idea which was up and which was down . he held the controls where they had been . sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip . his air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .

a royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms . further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 . in 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the governor-general , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered . but specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors . a unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time . the whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933 . general responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , service des affaires indigenes et de la main-d'oeuvre  aimo , af direction , af direction generale , gouvernement generale  . tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials . the district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics . the regulations require the inscription of each individual  male or female , adult or child  on a separate card  fiche  . the cards , filed by circonscription  sub-chiefdom , or village  , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire  chiefdom  . each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth  or age at a specified time  , spouses , and children . additional entries must be made from time to time . different cards are used for males and females , and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach puberty . so a quick count could be made at any time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes . personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded . similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females . each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand . the registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons . the cards of permanent out-migrants are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence . finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions . numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each year . in addition , demographic inquiries , supposedly involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions  circonscriptions  containing about 3 percent of the total population . the results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death rates , general fertility rates , distributions by marital status , fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households , infant mortality , and migration . the areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , supposedly as representative of a larger population . averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population . the scheme , in theory , is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions of african life . but it places a severe strain on the administrative resources  already burdened in other ways  of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population . the sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies . the system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers . the distinction between domiciled  de jure  and present  de facto  population was not clearly defined . so the results are subject to considerable confusion . the system tended to break down during the war , but was reactivated ; ; it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951 . in spite of the defects in this system , the figures on total population during the late 1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity . but the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading . the same system , with minor modifications , was developed in ruanda-urundi under belgian administration . here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods . before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa . a number of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo and ruanda-urundi . the work of fonds reine elisabeth pour l'assistance medicale aux indigenes du congo belge  foreami  has special interest with respect to demography . this agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the kwango district and adjacent areas east of leopoldville . each year from 1941 on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the incidence of major diseases . its findings are reported each year in its rapport sur l'activite pendant annee  bruxelles  . somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas . other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography . these studies vary widely in scope and precision . l'institut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale  irsac  has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development of its official statistics . a massive investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in ruanda-urundi is being carried on by j. j. maquet , former director of the social science branch of irsac , now a professor at l'universite officielle du congo belge et du ruanda-urundi . some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items  collected by sub-chiefs in 1,100 circumscriptions  have been tabulated . the results are now being analyzed . statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs . the aimo organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the territories , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information . however , the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics . a bureau de la demographie  a. romaniuk , director  was formed under aimo in the congo , to work in close rapport with the section statistique of the secretariat general . eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to the demographic division of the central statistical office . the 1952 demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi was directed by v. neesen , a member of the irsac staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices of aimo , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory . a member of the irsac staff  e. van de walle  was recently delegated to cooperate with aimo in the development of demographic statistics in this territory . the initiation of sampling censuses in ruanda-urundi  1952  and in the congo  1955 - 57  were major advances . we will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into operation later than the other . the radical nature of the innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements . the term enquetes demographiques , previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative censuses , was used for the new investigations . however , the differences in procedure are fundamental . these are as follows :  1  field work procedures . field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time african investigators  three teams , each working in two provinces  . these teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas .  2  nature of the sample . sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits . in short , scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling . the populations of the various districts , or other major divisions , were stratified by type of community  rural , urban , mixed  and , where appropriate , by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy . sample units  villages in rural areas , houses in cities  were drawn systematically within these strata .  3  size of the sample . different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions . higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas . about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries .  4  questions and definitions . uniform questions , definitions , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country . data were obtained , separately , on three classes of persons :  a  residents , present ; ;  b  residents , absent ; ; and  c  visitors . in the reports , summary results are given for both the de facto  a and c  and de jure  a and b  populations ; ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population  or , in some districts , only the de facto population  . these changes represent , in effect , a shift from  1  an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to  2  a systematic sampling census of the whole african population . the population registration system still has important functions . it supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations . it provides a frame for the sampling census . it also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force  though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this source in the near future  . it is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates is open to question . finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values . even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present  especially children in relatively stable communities  and supplementary information  such as records of marital status  for many others . the quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries . furthermore , it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method  as distinguished from sampling error  in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , mortality , and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction . the first sampling census in the congo extended over a three-year period , 1955 - 57 ; ; the results were still being processed in 1959 . it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more expeditiously . it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at five-year intervals . reports already issued on the sampling census , 1955 - 57 , in various areas run as follows  using only the french and omitting corresponding flemish titles  . this report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables . other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued . these area reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods .

st. johns , mich. , april 19 . -- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs. anna hengesbach . pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . he returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last july , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , jack walker , or his guard . stepson vindicated the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , vincent hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in december , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . mrs. hengesbach was killed on aug. 31 , 1958 . hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . when the verdict came in against his young neighbor , hengesbach said :  i am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . still , i do not wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' . lives on welfare hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the westphalia area by state police . he also admitted killing mrs. hengesbach . however , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial . charges in doubt assistant prosecutor fred lewis , who tried both the hengesbach and pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against pohl . circuit judge paul r. cash did not set a date for sentencing . pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . locked in motel a verdict against pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-12 hours of deliberation . the jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced . the jury foreman , mrs. olive heideman , of rural elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence . she said the jurors agreed that pohl's confession was valid . the jury asked judge cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . the verdict came three hours later . some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . the trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . a sterling township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . while neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit henry kowalski family , 34220 viceroy . mrs. eleanor kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in holy cross hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , mrs. mary pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of warren . services tomorrow funeral services for mrs. kowalski and her daughter , christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in st. anne's catholic church , 31978 mound , in warren . the mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in mt. olivet cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the lyle elliott funeral home , 31730 mound , warren . mrs. pankowski , 61 , remained in holy cross hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while mrs. kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 eight mile road east . held candle assistant fire chief chester cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . christine's twin sister , patricia , and darlene kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . they are home now with the other kowalski children , vicky , 14 ; ; dennis , 6 ; ; eleanor , 2 ; ; and bernardine , 1 .  all we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way mother wanted '' , kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon . kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills . a135 donated neighbor women , such as mrs. sidney baker , 2269 serra , sterling township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with kowalski's sister-in-law , mrs. anna kowalski , 22111 david , east detroit . another neighbor , mrs. frank c. smith , 2731 pall mall , sterling township , surprised kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with 135 collected locally toward the 400 funeral costs . john c. houghton , president of the tareytown acres homeowners association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the kowalski family . students help out houghton said 6 p.m. friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of dequindre and 14 mile road east . he said contributions also could be mailed to post office box 553 , warren village station . vicky kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost 25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at fuhrmann junior high school , 5155 fourteen mile road east . principal clayton w. pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that y-teen club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse monday for mrs. kowalski . funds from dances student council officers announced today the kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for fuhrmann's 770 students this friday night .  furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for vicky and sympathy for her entire family , pohly said . there also were reports of a collection at the county line elementary school , 3505o dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the kowalski children including christine . expresses thanks kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday . but today he wanted to make a public statement .  i never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family . i was not sure there were such people anywhere in the world . i will need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them '' . an alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . patrolman george kimmell , of mcclellan station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for ralph sisk , 9230 vernor east , a third grader at the scripps school , for his assistance in the case . kimmell said he and ralph were helping children across belvidere at kercheval monday afternoon when a car heading north on belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk . gets car number kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly  took off at high speed '' , he said , narrowly missing him . commandeering a passing car , kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . the motorist later was identified as richard sarkees , 17 , of 2433 mcclellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive . given 15 days he was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by traffic judge george t. murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the detroit house of correction . the jail sentence is to begin the day after sarkees graduates from eastern high school in june . the long crisis in laos appeared nearing a showdown today . britain announced that it is asking the soviet union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire . help asked in vientiane , the royal laotian government decided today to ask its  friends and neighbors '' for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast asian kingdom . britain's plans to press russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in london by foreign secretary lord home . he said britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to new delhi and from there to laos to verify the cease-fire . a 14-power conference on laos should then meet on may 5 , he said . plea for arms the laos government plea for help was made by foreign minister tiao sopsaisana . he indicated that requests would be made for more u.s. arms and more u.s. military advisers . he declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . one of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the united states to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body . a note making the request was handed to u.s. ambassador winthrop g. brown . heavy support the laos government said four major pathet lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from communist north viet nam . the minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 communist north vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near thakhek , in southern-central laos . there was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . in the past such government claims have been found exaggerated . havana , april 19 . -- two americans and seven cubans were executed by firing squads today as castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair . the executions took place at dawn only a few hours after havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at pinar del rio , where the executions took place . arms plot charged the broadcast said anderson , a seattle ex-marine and havana businessman , and mcnair , of miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to cuban rebels . anderson operated three havana automobile service stations and was commander of the havana american legion post before it disbanded since the start of fidel castro's regime . anderson's wife and four children live in miami . mcnair , 25 , was seized march 20 with four cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in pinar del rio , about 35 miles from havana . report others held at least 20 other americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup . among them were a number of newsmen , including henry raymont , of united press international , and robert berrellez , of associated press . so many cubans were reported being swept into the castro dragnet that the massive sports palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails . more than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them roman catholic priests . of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in siberia as political prisoners of the soviet state , few emerge in the west to tell about it . m. kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in bucharest and a member of the armenian revolutionary federation  arf  -- two reasons the communists put him away when they arrived in 1945 . today , m. kegham was in detroit , en route to join his wife and children in california .

people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it . the room filled with smoke , and maggie's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to quench it . little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery . in two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head . she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her . she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her . maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating . worry had a great deal to do with it ; ; stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him . mr. clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap . maggie and stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more . in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon :  do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money , so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? ?  it seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , eugenia said . she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again .  i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something '' , maggie said .  it would make me feel a lot better , but the woman's exchange is not taking baked goods any more and i cannot leave the baby with grandma because she is not strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery '' .  i should think so '' , eugenia said .  for one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day '' .  she's so beautiful , and i do like to keep her looking nice '' . maggie said . she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck .  she will be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed '' , eugenia said .  evadna mae evans said she did not put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old '' .  evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best's liliputian bazaar in new york , and i am sick and tired of hearing about evadna mae evans '' .  well now , maggie , you do not have to snap at me '' , eugenia said .  i am just thinking of a way for you to be sensible '' .  i am sorry . i do seem to snap at everybody these days , but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money '' .  well , let's see . let's make a list of your assets '' . maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining . when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures .  i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , eugenia said .  we could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it is nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that '' .  what else '' ? ?  you might set up a dress shop in the living room '' .  every woman in the block has tried that '' .  what about a tea room , then ? ? you could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes '' .  it is too elaborate . and grandma is not strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am i '' . eugenia sighed . she said ,  well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do not like any of those i can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough '' .  oh , i am sure i could do that '' , maggie said .  but it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you '' .  do not worry , i can get plenty more '' , eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could . maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it .  and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time . and i can go back to my contests and be thinking while i am doing the washing '' .  what are you going to do with your feet so you do not waste anything '' ? ? maggie laughed . she said ,  oh eugenia , i wish ''  what '' ? ?  i wish i had three wishes '' , maggie said .  all of them for you '' . it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people . the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days . the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources . the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies . there weren't facilities to take care of them ; ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities . that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates . the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay . the government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything . shivering , people talked and argued ; ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done . something had to be done ; ; it was the theme song of millions of american people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government . something had to be done . the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day . something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day . just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster . the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold . cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof . presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in grandma's room . it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive . the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms . they lived mainly in the kitchen ; ; they moved maggie's bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds . grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to .  you said a mouthful '' , eugenia said grimly . eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin . she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever .  plenty of people are poor all their lives '' .  plenty of people have not our brains and talent '' .  i know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , maggie said .  you're working up to something , and if you do not watch out you will ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression '' .  the only thing that worries me is how i am going to prove it '' , eugenia said . they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way . she did not want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that hope have the heater . hope wouldn't hear of it , and she took the heater back to grandma's room , and grandma took it back to hope's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire . she said that proved she was not to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it . eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but hope said if grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so grandma had to give in .

it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right people or there were only a few wrong people in the town . alfred wanted to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build a larger place . it was a very tempting offer . my father would have done it if it hadn't been for my mother , who had a fear of being in debt to anyone -- even alfred alpert . in spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about alfred . they had my mother's opinion of him : that he was too sharp or a little too good to be true . one of the people who was afraid of alfred was his own brother , lew . i do not know how and i do not know why but the two stores , the one in margaretville and the one in fleischmanns that had been set up as a partnership , were dissolved , separated from each other . everything was all very friendly , except when it came to harry , the youngest brother . alfred , who was a good deal older than harry , had treated him like a son , and when harry decided to stay in business with lew instead of going with alfred , alfred looked on the decision as a betrayal . from that day on he never spoke to harry or to lew , or to lew's two boys , mort and jimmy . the six miles between the towns became an ocean and the alperts became a family of strangers . time went on and everybody got older . i became fifteen , sixteen , then twenty , and still tessie alpert sat on the porch with a rose in her hair , and alfred got richer and sicker with diabetes . it was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and tessie and alfred found out that they did not know each other . they were like two strangers . the store was their marriage , and when alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together . tessie , everybody thought , was a strong woman , but she was only strong because she had alfred to lean on . and when alfred was forced into his bed , tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home , rocking in her rocker in the living room , staring out the window -- the rose still in her hair . tessie could do nothing for alfred . she couldn't cook or clean or make him comfortable . instead she waited for alfred to get better and take care of her . spring was life -- and alfred alpert in his sickroom was death . alfred knew that , too . i remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't . alfred began to put his affairs in order , and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage . my father , who liked alfred very much , was a constant visitor . one day alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me . my father , a wise man , asked him not to . he knew alfred liked me ; ; if he wanted to leave me something let it be a trinket , nothing else . by leaving me everything he wouldn't be doing me a favor , my father told him , and he did not want to see his daughter involved in a lawsuit . he did not want alfred to leave me trouble because that's all it would be , and alfred understood . alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home . the doctor wanted him in a hospital ; ; the nearest one was forty miles away in kingston . the day alfred left his home and fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime . he sent me for meltzer the butcher , whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi . meltzer knew why i had come for him . solemnly he walked me back to alfred's house without a word passing between us . he entered the house in silence , walked into alfred's room , and closed the door behind him . i sat down to wait , and i watched tessie alpert , who hadn't moved or said a word but kept staring out of the window . for a few minutes there was nothing to hear . then meltzer's voice , quiet , calm , strong , started the kaddish , the prayer for the dead . i could hear alfred's voice a few words behind meltzer's like a counterpoint , punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation . there was a finality in the rhythm of the prayer -- it was the end of a life , the end of hope , and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning . meltzer stayed with alfred , and when the door opened they both came out . alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital . the car was waiting for him . alfred , leaning on meltzer , stopped for a minute to look at tessie . she did not turn away from the window . alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door . outside , his brother harry was waiting for him -- he had come to say good-bye . alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car . harry ran to the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him , begging him to speak . alfred looked straight ahead . the car began to move and harry ran after it crying ,  alfred ! ! alfred ! ! speak to me '' . but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead . harry followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards kingston . he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight . i went to visit alfred in the kingston hospital a few times . the first time i went there he asked me to bring him water from flagler's well -- water that reminded him of his first days in the mountains -- and before i came the next time i filled a five-gallon jug for him and brought it to the hospital . i do not think he ever got to drink any of it . the jug stayed at the hospital and the water -- what can happen to water ? ? -- it evaporated , disappeared , and came back to the earth as rain -- maybe for another well or another stream or another alfred alpert . 12  where is it written '' ? ? mr. banks was always called banks the butcher until he left town and the shop passed over to meltzer the scholar who then became automatically meltzer the butcher . meltzer was a boarder with the banks family . he came to fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought him to america from russia . he was a learned man and a very gentle soul . he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the talmud . he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak , very weak , on the therefores . banks the butcher took meltzer the scholar as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the commentaries of the talmud in order to live . so meltzer learned a new trade from banks , who supplied the town and the hotels with meat . banks had a family -- a wife , a daughter , and a son . the daughter , lilly , was a very good friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would find each other . they lived in the same house and it did not seem to be such a hard thing to do , but the sad realities of lilly's life and the fact that meltzer did not love her never satisfied my wishful thinking . banks the butcher was a hard master and a hard father , a man who did not seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade . he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt ; ; perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks . lilly banks and i became friends . she was the opposite of everything she should have been -- a positive pole in a negative home , a living reaction of warmth and kindness to the harsh reality of her father . and lilly's whole family seemed to be an apology for mr. banks . her brother karl was a very gentle soul , her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard , probing eyes . for every rude word of mr. banks's the family had five in apology . every chance i got i left the hotel to visit lilly . i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of meltzer lightened . she had to clean the glass on the display cases in the butcher shop , help her brother scrub the cutting tables with wire brushes , mop the floors , put down new sawdust on the floors and help check the outgoing orders . when these chores were finished , only then , was she allowed whatever freedom she could find . i helped lilly in the store . to me it was a game , to her it was the deadly seriousness of life . i wanted to help so that we could find time to play . and lilly allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape . when the work was finished , we would walk . the road past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream . it ran north , away from the town and the people , through woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard . lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk . i would have liked the town and the busyness of its people but i always followed lilly into the peace of the silent and unstaring road . it was not hard to understand . to me lilly was a fine and lovely girl . to people who did not know her she was a gawky , badly dressed kid whose arms were too long , whose legs were a little too bony . she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the street . and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked . it was unexpected , unexpected because lilly walked with her head bent down , down , and her mark of friendship was to look into your face . i accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness ; ; childishness compared to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins . we were almost the same age , she was fifteen , i was twelve , and where i felt there was a life to look forward to lilly felt she had had as much of it as was necessary . when we went for our walks lilly's brother would come along every once in a while . karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected . this huge hulk played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream . karl played well and his favorite song was a schubert lullaby . he spoke no german but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language . the song , he said , was called  the stream's lullaby '' , and when he sang ,  gute ruh , gute ruh , mach't die augen zu , '' there was such longing and such simple sadness that it frightened me . later , when i was older , i found the song was part of schubert's die schone mullerin . and even hearing it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and the melody would make me a little colder and i would reach out for my husband's hand . the brother and sister seemed to be a sort of mutual-aid society , a little fortress of kindness for each other in a hard world . i felt very flattered to be included in the protection of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from .

thomas douglas , fifth earl of selkirk , a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands , conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north . since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the hudson's bay company , he purchased great blocks of the comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies . having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers . the grant , which stretched southward to lake traverse -- the headwaters of the red -- was made in may , 1811 , and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay . thus at the same time that william henry harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of indiana territory and winning fame at the battle of tippecanoe , anglo-saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the north american continent to the west of the american agricultural frontier . seven hundred miles south of york factory , at  the forks '' of the red and the assiniboine , twenty-three men located a settlement in august 1812 . by october the little colony about fort douglas  present-day winnipeg  numbered 100 . within a few years the scots , engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley , were joined by a group called meurons . the latter , members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of 1812 , had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in 1815 . selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire . the mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818 . it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward . when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed , all but fifty of the scots , swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river . here they built huts and a stockade named fort daer after selkirk's barony in scotland . the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food . the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders . for many years the northwest company had its southern headquarters at prairie du chien on the mississippi river , some 300 miles southeast of present-day st. paul , minnesota . when in 1816 an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states , its british-born employees , now become american citizens -- joseph rolette , joseph renville and alexis bailly -- continued in the fur business . on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river , robert dickson , superintendent of the western indian department of canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces . his trading goods came from canada to the forks of red river and from selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts . these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun . in 1802 henry referred to  our new carts '' as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack . they were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills . it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states . in september 1817 at fort daer  pembina  dickson met the noble lord whom , with the help of a band of sioux , he escorted to prairie du chien . during the trip selkirk decided that the route through illinois territory to indiana and the eastern united states was the best route for goods from england to reach red river and that the united states was a better source of supply for many goods than either canada or england . upon arriving at baltimore , selkirk on december 22 wrote to john quincy adams , secretary of state at washington , inquiring about laws covering trade with  missouri and illinois territories '' . this traffic , he declared prophetically ,  tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our settlements . '' the route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected . in 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at  the forks ''  fort douglas  and in december 1819 , twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien . it was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats . with these completed and ice gone from the st. peter's river  present-day minnesota river  their 250 bushels of wheat , 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to big stone lake , across into lake traverse , and down the red . they reached fort douglas in june 1820 . this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab1,040 . nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food . thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round . activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in 1819 to send lieutenant-colonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of prairie du chien , until then the most advanced united states post . in september 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st. peter's river , the head of navigation on the mississippi , and began construction of fort st. anthony which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander , colonel josiah snelling . it was from the american outposts that red river shortages of livestock were to be made good . hercules l. dousman , fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien , contracted to supply selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle , and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers . bailly , after leaving fort snelling in august 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudson's bay company's post on lake traverse  in the sieux country '' and reached fort garry , as the selkirk hudson's bay company center was now called , late in the fall . he set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed swiss who turned their eyes toward the united states . observing their distressing condition , colonel snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation . as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota , dousman of michilimackinac , michigan , and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise . early in 1822 he was at fort garry offering to bring in pork , flour , liquor and tobacco . alexander mcdonnell , governor of red river , and james bird , a chief factor of the hudson's bay company , ordered such  sundry articles '' to a value of ab4,500 . for its part the hudson's bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement . as the time drew near for the drawing of the british-american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the pembina colony -- its own post and fort daer -- was on american territory . accordingly selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north , and by october , john halkett had torn down both posts , floating the timber to  the forks '' in rafts .  i have done everything '' , he wrote ,  to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment . '' despite company threats , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder , ball , and thread for fishing nets , about 350 persons stayed in the village . they would attempt to bring supplies from st. louis or prairie du chien at  great expense as well as danger '' . at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling . the disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave . after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on october 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick . in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-june . on june 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the mississippi . by fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling , but most of them were sent on to galena and st. louis , with a few going as far as vevay , indiana , a notable swiss center in the united states . in 1837 , 157 red river people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling . below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the mississippi river . at the point where they ended , another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in 1840 . its people , including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry , were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may 1840 . the resultant town , platted in 1847 and named for the patron of father galtier's mission , st. paul , was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those selkirkers who remained at red river . while population at fort garry increased rapidly , from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840 , economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate . accordingly , though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudson's bay company , some settlers went into trade . the company maintained a store at which products of england could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs . despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs . in june 1845 , the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via hudson's bay which were viewed as aimed at the  very vitals of the company's trade and power '' . to reduce further the flow of goods from england , the company's local officials asked that its london authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men . with their customary source of supply cut off , the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country . others carried pemmican from  the forks '' to st. paul and goods from st. paul to red river , as in the summer of 1847 when one trader , wells , transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement . this trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after february 1835 , but much was smuggled into assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the london committee . the trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel .

a good man departs . goodby , mr. sam . sam rayburn was a good man , a good american , and , third , a good democrat . he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; ; mr. speaker , mr. sam , and mr. democrat , at one and the same time . the house was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , speaker of the house , and second most powerful man in washington . mr. rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label . he was no flaming liberal , yet the new deal , the fair deal and the new frontier needed him . he was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any . two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word . sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction . it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs . the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical . his leadership was not for audiences . a growl , a nod , was usually enough . when it was not , one of the great dramas of washington would be presented . he would rise in the well of the house , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence . he spoke briefly , sensibly , to the point and without oratorical flourishes . he made good , plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it . these public efforts were rare because mr. rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor . he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them . with his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political leader . he was , of course , in the house for a very long time . there are only two men remaining in congress who , with rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 . to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr. sam coincided with that of the house . and it was the house he loved . to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition . the senate to him was not the  upper body '' and he corrected those who said he served  under '' the president . he served  with '' him . sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death . woodrow wilson , with whom he began his years in washington , warren g. harding , calvin coolidge , fdr , with whom he managed a social revolution . and those still with us , herbert c. hoover , harry s. truman , dwight d. eisenhower and john f. kennedy . he was a fighter for those of his own party . mr. truman has only to recall the  hopeless '' campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr. kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr. sam been there . as it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration . with republican presidents , he fought fair . he was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist . he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was born to play . under any name -- mr. speaker , mr. democrat , mr. sam -- he was a good man . un off the congo track thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends . in 18 months , no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle . simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river . the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries . in other words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga . does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it ? ? to the contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence . mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences . yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga . it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it . the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms ? ? the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa . right now , they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga . that notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view . the un army is too weak , too demoralized for the task . further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned . last , it makes no sense to deliver katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos . the congo should have been mandated , because it was not ready for independence . the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom . it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism . but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach . otherwise , un will march blindly on to certain defeat . featherbed reversal a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the southern pacific co. and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information . the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year . our comment was that this was  featherbedding '' in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement . the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life . additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need . also , normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic . the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries . the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands . meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side . but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in st. louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful , despite an imperfection here and there . it was , the brief writers decided ,  man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world '' . peace , it is wonderful , and  world law '' , it is wonderful , too , and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon ? ? meanwhile , in moscow , khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who cannot see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism . a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st. louis to the moon , where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink . while he was at it , the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who cannot appreciate coexistence thru suicide .  fools '' , he bayed ,  what do you think you are doing '' ? ? the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort . another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun . the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana , where , for some unknown reason , castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old ten o'clock shadow . the plane was sent back to the united states , for a change , but castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution . less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castro's right hand man , che guevara , who edified the inter-american economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas , venezuela . the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen , who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium . perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes , but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests , these things would not happen . the same can be said about the half-hearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april , which , we trust , is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev . pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it is getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away . the customer loses again . the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month . the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway , which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car . by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines . the board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws .

the flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head .  tie him up '' .  hell with it '' . before they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard . the man went over without sound , falling to the bare floor . barton said harshly ,  why did you do that '' ? ? rankin sneered at him .  what did you want me to do , kiss him ? ? he dumped me in solitary twice '' . barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around .  let's get one thing straight , you and me . the only reason we brought you was to get miller out . if you ever try anything without my orders i will kill you '' . fred rankin looked at him . it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now .  come on . let's move '' . they filed out through the guard-room door , into the paved square . there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks . there was no chance . they moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall . there was no moon . they had chosen this night purposely . they reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and powers slipped through the door . two men were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed . they looked up in surprise as powers came in .  what are you doing out of the block '' ? ?  it is curtiss '' , he said , naming the man rankin had hit .  i have got to have help '' . they stared at him . the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet .  what is wrong with him '' ? ?  he's having some kind of a fit '' . the sergeant turned to the door . as he passed through it barton shoved his gun against the man's side .  one sound and you're dead '' . the sergeant froze . powers had not followed . powers was covering the remaining guard . the man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell . powers knocked his arm aside . deliberately , with none of rankin's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head . they were free . even barton could not quite believe it . it had gone without a hitch . they slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground . five minutes later they reached the horses . barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts . he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the escape party they would be short . no one hurried . they walked the horses , heading along the river , barton and emmett foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night . the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts . five miles . in a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees . foster had brought extra clothing also . a good man , emmett . he had been one of the original night riders , one who had escaped the trial . it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on dill's release from the prison . clyde miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt . kid boyd was unusually silent , rankin watchful , a few paces apart . barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers .  i will not even try to thank you '' . the ex-prison guard was embarrassed . he said in a studied voice ,  i did not do it for you . i did it for the valley . you're the only man the night riders will follow . we've been starving and i do not like to starve '' . barton turned away , his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse .  good luck '' . the murderer lifted his head .  meaning you want me to ride out '' ? ?  you aren't one of us . there's nothing for you here '' .  i got no place to go '' . barton hesitated . he did not trust rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct . but ten years in prison had taught him realities . they were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money . it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them night riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure . but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side .  your choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to kid boyd .  bury those uniforms so they will not be found '' . then barton touched carl dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank . he wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley . they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently . he too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco . mitchell barton drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled . through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly . for his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell . carl dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man . he had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money . he had done time for the theft . the one thing they had in common was their hatred . both hated donald kruger . it had drawn them together , and since his release from prison dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape . he said now ,  i have got the perfect headquarters set up . the old haskell mine '' . mitch barton knew the place . twenty years before a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley . they had spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel . then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned .  the road's washed badly '' , said dill ,  but there's a trail you can get over with a horse . a company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' . barton nodded .  how do the valley people feel '' ? ?  as mad as ever . but kruger's men keep them off balance , and they do not trust me . i am an outsider . when they learn you're in the hills though , they will rally , do not worry about that '' . barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind .  my boy . did you find him '' ? ? dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension .  he's in morgan's ferry '' . barton half-straightened in surprise .  what is he doing there '' ? ? again dill hesitated .  dealing faro '' .  dealing faro ? ? how come '' ? ?  your sister-in-law has the faro bank in cap ayres' saloon '' . barton cursed under his breath . after another long pause he asked ,  how many people know who they are '' ? ?  everyone . your cousin finley saw to that . he's quite a rat , you know . he sold out to kruger's men . he's informed them of everything you have ever written him . he wants your ranch '' . barton stood up . he said tensely ,  all right . let's go get the boy '' . dill had come up also .  i was afraid of this . i almost did not tell you '' .  if you hadn't i had have killed you '' . dill's voice tightened .  but you cannot ride into the ferry . that's what they will expect you to do . they will be there waiting for you . i understand how you feel about the child . ''  the hell you do '' . barton's voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it .  i never saw him . my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away .  i cannot leave him there . donald kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and i wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care . i have got to get the boy . let's ride '' . chapter two barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult . it was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state . it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame . it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield . it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences . for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence . creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit . the office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove . the building was dwarfed by the scene outside . there a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside . the gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth . it was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire hoses , and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices . a million dollars' of gold a month . a million tons of rock and soil and brush . the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day . their roar , like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles . hague , like all who worked near the pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums . he was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air . fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt . ten years older than mitch barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation . he was proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted him . he lived and breathed for the mining company . no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life . there came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room . hague had never accustomed himself to kodyke . the man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose . the eyes always held hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard's , with the fixed intensity of a cobra . even hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke . he knew nothing about the man's history . kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger . kodyke was to head the dread company police . he ran the change rooms . he threw out the hi-graders . he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to san francisco . hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike . he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype .  this is mitchell barton . he broke out of folsom last night . apparently he bribed one of the guards . we want him back there or we want him dead '' . kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully .  dangerous '' ? ?  dangerous , yes . you know how the ranchers in the valley are . they blame us for all their troubles . ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches . it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them . we do not want barton's night riders loose again '' . the gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing . normally hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew kodyke was aware of all he said .

 good old a-z '' , cap said .  you know , i have got one of your cars at home . as a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group . is not his racket down your alley '' ? ? once it was , william thought . but not any more . a rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot cap . how did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ? simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law . general hershey's draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first eminence , but fearless freddy bryan could take credit , if he cared to  and he did  , for the second time . freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry , and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one . mr. willis bought zenith plastic products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed freddy in an executive position . shortly after , freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas . willis listened patiently , and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns . probably mr. willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren . gerry began to aid freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating competency . another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis' fortune ; ; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy , the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death . whatever the reasons , willis and bryan started expanding zenith . they acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators . since they were hunting for national defense contracts , adam herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections . feeling his power , freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer . heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him . the allstates auto company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism . cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . with herberet's blessing , he was convinced that allstates' wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind . at that point william came into the picture . although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of zenith . freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he was not entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities . mr. willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and william set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to wisconsin and washington . in the end , he said :  i am not enchanted by the proposition , sir . i know a guy named jack hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler , and i took him with me to allstates . it is his expert opinion that the plant is not well suited to what you have in mind . the conversion will cost a fortune . besides that , i am acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force . i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side . missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here . the future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes . this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough . here are a few facts and figures i have assembled . cannot you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ? willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged .  well '' , he said ,  there is freddy , you know . and gerry . freddy is deeply committed to our plans already . he assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and ham richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem . i do not like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution '' .  yes , i appreciate that . i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i am lukewarm ; ; i have caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me . if we do not take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels '' .  which is a frightful prospect , bill '' . willis laughed .  one shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case i have no choice . let me think about it . i am most grateful to you , so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy '' . not to william's surprise , freddy , adam and hamilton richert prevailed ; ; allied to them was gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further . zenith absorbed allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination . through jack hamrick , william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and clay . he forgot about a-z till , unhappily , he and hamrick were proved correct . freddy's backing dropped away from him and mr. willis was forced to make up the deficit . adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end . the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant . stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value . confronted by a grim future , freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation . once more willis summoned william .  you were right '' , he said --  you and your engineer -- and i am in something of a bind . freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me . in addition to other defects , i am a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment . will you see if you can help me '' ? ? william spent a long week end closeted with hamrick . his recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of a-z's useless wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick's that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it . initially , hamrick's reaction to a-z going into the passenger car market was discouraging . he thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult . then he caught fire . if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if william could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable . they took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . taking hamrick with him , william went to mr. willis . he was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report .  your alternative is breathtaking '' , he said ,  and , i am frank in saying , a bit mad . i wish i was younger and less timid . well , i cannot resolve this myself . i will have to call in the brain trust . are you willing to run the gantlet ? ? i cannot guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' .  we'll be in there swinging '' , william said ,  but in a way , sir , you have got to decide it yourself . you have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage . if they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' . he paused .  i should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you . you mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away . i hate that . you're -- you're arthur willis . forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .  i rather like the music '' , willis replied quietly .  thank you '' . at the meeting , attended by freddy , richert , herberet and the a-z executive staff , with mr. willis presiding , william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet . from shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity .  oh , my god '' , ham richert said ,  a little child shall lead them . move over , general motors '' .  it is absurd , bill '' , freddy said , from a pale face .  you're leading dad down the garden path '' .  your garden , god damn it '' ! ! william said .  i do not enjoy family quarrels '' , adam said .  nor crazy relatives . we're here to transact business . cannot we put an end to this , arthur '' ? ?  hear me out , please '' , william begged .  i am an advertising hustler , i admit , but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere . sure , ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big three . their cars weren't small enough , they did not have the power , they were old-fashioned . they tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit . we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery . we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age . look what those little european jobs are doing . we'll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight . let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates . ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made . we've got rid of the steam yachts and georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next . why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an allstates-zenith '' ? ? he swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on . financing emerged as the main obstacle . mr. willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum .  nobody will underwrite it , i am telling you '' , freddy said .  i know what i am talking about in that department '' .  there's plenty of risk money '' , ham richert added ,  but not for anything this risky '' .  all right '' , william said .  we'll try to swing the deal on that basis . if we cannot raise the capital , we're through . nothing has been lost . you're up against it anyhow . why will not you give me a chance '' ? ? a silence fell . heads instinctively turned in willis' direction . he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together .  i feel i must answer the question '' , he said ,  since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- i do not relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family . i am not giving you a chance , bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance . good luck to you '' .  all the in-laws have got to have their day '' , adam said , and glared at william and freddy in turn . sweat started out on william's forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell . across the table , hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger . nobody else showed pleasure . spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy league suit , jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club .  hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned .  i suppose i can never expect to call you ' general ' after that washington episode '' .  i am afraid not '' .

payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold . there was a fog , which increased the darkness of the night . two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow . he might have been anywhere or nowhere . the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from dr. verdi . secretary of state seward was a sick man . the idea had come from herold , who had once been a chemist's clerk . the sick were always receiving medicines . no one would question such an errand . the bottle was filled up with flour . before payne loomed the old clubhouse , seward's home , where key had once been killed . now it would have another death . from the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry . he clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell . like the bell at mass , the doorbell was pitched too high . it was still good friday , after all . a nigger boy opened the door . payne did not notice him . he was thinking chiefly of cap . if their schedules were to synchronize , there was no point in wasting time . he pushed his way inside . for a moment the hall confused him . this was the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel . he had no idea where seward's room would be . in the half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous . above him somewhere were the bedrooms . seward would be up there . he explained his errand , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army . he did not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving way to it . he was no longer worried . everything would be all right . he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped . still , the sensation always surprised him . it was a thrill he felt no part in . he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things . he brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs . they were carpeted , but made for pumps and congress gaiters , not the great clodhoppers he wore . the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum . at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown . he stopped and whispered his errand . young frederick seward held out his hand . panting a little , payne shook his head . dr. verdi had told him to deliver his package in person . frederick seward said his father was sleeping , and then went through a pantomime at his father's door , to prove the statement .  very well '' , payne said .  i will go '' . he smiled , but now that he knew where the elder seward was , he did not intend to go . he pulled out his pistol and fired it . it made no sound . it had misfired . reversing it , he smashed the butt down on frederick seward's head , over and over again . it was the first blow that was always difficult . after that , violence was exultantly easy . he got caught up into it and became a different person . only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real . the nigger boy fled down the stairs , screaming ,  murder '' . it was not murder at all . payne was more methodical than that . he was merely clearing a way to what he had to do . he ran for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away . a knife would do . from childhood he had known all about knives . someone blocked the door from inside . he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness . he saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled . he went for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly . it was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams . two men pulled him off . nobody said anything . payne hacked at their arms . there was a lady there , in a nightdress . he would not have wanted to hurt a lady . another man approached , this one fully dressed . when the knife went into his chest , he went down at once .  i am mad '' , shouted payne , as he ran out into the hall .  i am mad '' , and only wished he had been . that would have made things so much easier . but he was not mad . he was only dreaming . he clattered down the stairs and out of the door . somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder . one always wakes up , even from one's own dreams . the clammy air revived him . herold , he saw , had fled . well , one did not expect much of people like herold . he unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on . the nigger boy was close behind him . then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone . he rode on and on . he had no idea where he was . after some time he came to an open field . an open field was better than a building , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass . he felt curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ; he knew he should get to cap , but he did not know how . he was sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he ? ? cap would find him and take care of him . so choosing a good tree , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable notch , and curled up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though surfeited with honey . violence always made him tired , but he was not frightened . in boston , edwin booth was winding up a performance of a new way to pay old debts . it was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more . acting soothed him . on a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual . as sir giles overreach  how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it  , he raised his arm and declaimed :  where is my honour now '' ? ? that was one of the high spots of the play . the audience , as usual , loved it . he was delighted to see them so happy . if he had any worries , it was only the small ones , about mother in new york , and his daughter edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her aunt asia , in philadelphia . everyone is ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you . they made the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not . 7 , wilkes was quite right about one thing . laura keene had been in the green room . the commotion had brought her into the wings . since she could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer mr. lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to miss harris , who had asked for it . she had been one of the first to collect her wits . it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already . most of them had seen our american cousin before , and unless miss keene was on stage , there was not much to it . the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom . the stage had been empty , except for harry hawk , doing his star monologue . the audience was fond of harry hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny . at the end of the monologue the audience would applaud . meanwhile it looked at the scenery .  well , i guess i know enough to turn you inside out , you sockdologizing old mantrap '' ! ! said trenchard , otherwise hawk . there was always a pause here , before the next line . that was when the gun went off . yet even that explosion did not mean much . guns were going off all over washington city these days , because of the celebrations , and the theatre was not soundproof . then the audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box .  sic semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly . booth had delivered his line . behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke . they strained forward . they had not heard what had been said . they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily . the figure leapt from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag draped there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up . harry hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings . his speech faltered . he did not lower his arm . the figure was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one . the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon . this figure looked like the slave dealer from that . but it also looked like a toad , hopping away from the light . there was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them . then it disappeared into the wings . harry hawk had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm . mrs. lincoln screamed . there was no mistaking that scream . it was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do . yet this scream had a different note in it . that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water . clara harris , one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water . her action was involuntary . when something unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man . mrs. lincoln screamed again . in the presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled :  he has shot the president '' ! ! that got everybody up . on the stage , harry hawk began to weep . laura keene brushed by him with the glass of water . the crowd began to move . in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of plots , and one death might attract another . it was not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there . the beehive voices , for no one could bear silence , drowned out the sound of mrs. lincoln's weeping . at the rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor . it would not give . a dr. charles taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box . in the audience a man named ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led miss harris to demand water . someone opened the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor . somehow dr. charles leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor . he went straight to the presidential box . as usual , mrs. lincoln had lost her head , but nobody blamed her for doing so now . there was a little blood on the hem of her dress , for the assassin had slashed miss harris's companion , major rathbone , with a knife . rathbone said he was bleeding to death . by the look of him he was not that far gone .

unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future . some vocational training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities . current programs the present federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the smith-hughes act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of 7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics . since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this federal program . the george-barden act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to 29 million in addition to the 7 million under the smith act . the health amendment act of 1956 added 5 million for practical nurse training . the latest major change in this program was introduced by the national defense education act of 1958 , title 8 , of which amended the george-barden act . annual authorizations of 15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians . the federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools . the initiative , administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts . even the states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training . federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half . the state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it . throughout the history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either federal or state governments . today , federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education . the greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds . national defense considerations have been the major reason behind most federal training expenditures in recent decades . during world war 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities :  1  vocational education for national defense , and  2  war production training . the total cost of the five-year program was 297 million . for the smith-hughes , george-barden , and national defense act of 1958 , the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years was only about 740 million . no comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training . there are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools . in addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training programs . a recent study indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations . most skilled industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions . the national manpower council of columbia university has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained . there is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education . employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training . vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills . in most states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools , usually located in the larger cities . in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses . in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in pennsylvania 11 per cent . an important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools . for a number of years kentucky , louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties . these schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts . transportation may be provided from nearby school districts . courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted . the title 8 , program of the national defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools . by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states . they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas . an extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken . relation to new industry some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry . the major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators . a few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere . a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees . the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled . additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being . thus , besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts . few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry . the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant . local focus of programs the major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands . this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country . planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers . all the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content . furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys . local jobs can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical . while the u. s. department of labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning . the u. s. office of education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys . this procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment . elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills . no effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained . moreover , the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary . there simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable . much of the available information comes not from the federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states . proposals state and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities . there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs . a related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided . there is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job . however , there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training . again , one major difficulty is the local focus . a training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community . if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond . another problem is who will pay for the training . local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training . programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it . even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it . state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities . only the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs . if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states . however , if federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment . such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities . a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g. i. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate . this probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corps . a maximum of 600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home . a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor . instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training . such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located . this would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension training . personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual . his aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training .

quarter:--robert martin is the man. her visit to abbey-mill,

she was just another freighter from the states , and she seemed as commonplace as her name . she was the john harvey , one of those atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the u.s. fifteenth air force , to field marshal montgomery's eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 . the john harvey arrived in bari , a port on the adriatic , on november 28th , making for porto nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city's new and modern harbor . hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off berth 29 on the mole . if anyone thought of the john harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried . which was poison gas . it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront . for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud , poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons . throughout the early years of world war 2 , , reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas -- germany in russia , japan in china again . they were always denied . influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns . some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first . to silence extremists , to warn the axis , president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august :  from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare . i have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons .  however , evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources .  use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind . this country has not used them , and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them . i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies '' . the following month the invasion of italy was begun , and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy . bari was chosen as a depot , not only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields . any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne . it would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below . so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey . a detachment of six men from the 701st chemical maintenance company under first lt. howard d. beckstrom went aboard , followed by lt. thomas h. richardson , the cargo security officer . secrecy was paramount . only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks . no one else must know . thus , in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at bari . it was the night of december 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in bari . it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit . capt. a. b. jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried . he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy . on november 24th , they had made a raid on la maddalena . two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off bougie , sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the me-210 had made its first appearance . after it had reappeared the next two nights , jenks went to higher headquarters and said :  for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures . they're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic '' . but the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist . even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz , the commander who would conduct the  little blitz '' on london in 1944 , a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously . true , there had been raids on naples -- but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast . no , bari was out of range . more than that , allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army's sector . so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him . for jenks knew that bari's defenses were made of paper . the royal air force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available . there were no r.a.f. fighter squadrons on bari airfield . the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable . telephone communication was bad . and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command . it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k. vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom . a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped . then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers .  this harbor is a bomber's paradise '' , the britisher had said with frank grimness .  it is up to you to protect yourselves . we cannot expect any help from the fighters at foggia , either . they're all being used on offensive missions '' . vesole had been stunned . not fire until the bombs came down ! ! he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head . like hell ! ! like hell he'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out ? ? what would his guns guide on then -- the north star ? ? ensign vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put seaman 2c donald l. norton and seaman 1c william a. rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette . below decks , seaman 1c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home . above decks on the john harvey , lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy . there were lights glinting in the city , too , even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible . bari was asking for it , he thought . for five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold . richardson wondered when it would be unloaded . he hoped they would put in somewhere way , way down in the earth . the burden of his secret was pressing down on him , as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men . lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs . they seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as bari . nine of them had gone down the gangplank already . deck cadet james l. cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave . richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade . the other half of the crew , plus beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard . richardson glanced to sea and started slightly . damned if that was not a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- porto vecchio . the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette . then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward . his eyes boggled . it was a clear night and it was raining ! ! capt. michael a. musmanno , military governor of the sorrentine peninsula , had also seen and felt the  rain '' . but he had mistaken it for bugs . captain musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the sorrentine's civilian population . musmanno was on deck . at exactly 7:30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face . he snatched at it savagely . he turned the beam of his flashlight on it . he laughed . it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating . he frowned . but how could -- ? ? another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth . it was two feet long . it was not candy wrapping . it was  window '' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .  fermate '' ! ! musmanno bellowed to his italian crewmen .  stop ! ! stop the engines '' ! ! unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari . they had come from airports in the balkans , these hundred-odd junkers 88's . they had winged over the adriatic , they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill . they had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares . and they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on . after the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until british mp's shot it out . in that interval , the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor . merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss . the little unsinkable sank almost immediately . captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft . they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under . john bascom went down early , too . ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets . most of the junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs . vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire . he was wounded , but fought on . norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors . bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one , three and five . now the bascom was mortally wounded . luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt . the order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks .

statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according

for by now the original cause of the quarrel , philip's seizure of gascony , was only one strand in the spider web of french interests that overlay all western europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to the other . even so , edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that left england for rome during that period had very little to do with it . it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope . nogaret is hardly an impartial witness , and even he did not make his charges against boniface until the latter was dead , but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say . it was not merely a hunger for  money , gold and precious objects '' that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war to an end ; ; the pope was playing a dangerous game , with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears , and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs . when the negotiations began , his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily in abeyance , and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who , under charles of valois , the papal vicar of tuscany , were so valuable in the crusade against the colonna cardinals and their sicilian allies . if his circumspection in regard to philip's sensibilities went so far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of amadee's daughter , agnes , to the son of the dauphin of vienne -- a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas , for savoy and dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides -- for fear that he might seem to be favoring the anti-french coalition , he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return of gascony to edward , even though , as he admitted to the english ambassadors , he had been advised that the original cession was invalid . on the other hand , he did not want to offend edward either , and he found himself in a very difficult position . on the surface , the whole question was purely feudal . the french were now occupying gascony and flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited them by a breach of the feudal contract . but edward was invading scotland for precisely the same reason , and his insubordinate vassal was the ally of the king of france . boniface had to uphold the sacredness of the feudal contract at all costs , for it was only as suzerain of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he had any justification for his italian wars , but in the english-scottish-french triangle it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other two . because of these involvements in the matter at stake , boniface lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter , and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient reason why the english embassies to the curia proved so fruitless . but when the situation was so complicated that even nogaret , one of the principal actors in the drama , could misinterpret the pope's motives , it is possible that othon and his companions , equally baffled , attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause . this was boniface's monumental tactlessness .  tact '' , by its very derivation , implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other people , but the author of clericis laicos and unam sanctam , the wielder of the two swords , the papal sun of which the imperial moon was but a dim reflection , the peer of caesar and vice-regent of christ , was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten what they were like . he was a learned and brilliant man , one of the best jurists in europe and with flashes of penetrating insight , and yet in his dealings with other people , particularly when he tried to be ingratiating , he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives . this lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men as pierre flotte and his associates , that  brilliant group of mediocre men '' , as powicke calls them , who provided the brains for the french embassy that came to rome under the nominal leadership of the archbishop of narbonne , the duke of burgundy , and the count of st.-pol . they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence and astuteness , they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles like othon or even the older generation of clerks like hotham , and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized . boniface was later to explain to the english that robert of burgundy and guy de st.-pol were easy enough to do business with ; ; it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a frenchman or with a devil . to the pope , head of the universal church , to the duke of burgundy , taking full advantage of his position on the borders of france and of the empire , or to othon , who found it quite natural that he should do homage to edward for tipperary and to the count of savoy for grandson , flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely incomprehensible . and yet he made no pretense about it ; ; when the pope , trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature , said to him ,  you have already taken normandy . do you want to drive the king of england from all his overseas possessions '' ? ? the frenchman's answer was a terse  vous dites vrai '' . loyal and unscrupulous , with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies , he outmatched the english diplomats time and time again until , by a kind of poetic justice , he fell at the battle of courtrai , the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings . the english , relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior diplomatic skill , were also hampered in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home . the scots had found a new leader in william wallace , and edward's yearly expeditions across the border called for evermounting taxes , which only increased his difficulties with the barons and the clergy . he was unable to send any more help to his allies on the continent , and during the next few years many of them , left to resist french pressure unaided , surrendered to the inevitable and made their peace with philip . the defeat and death of adolf of nassau at the hands of albert of habsburg also worked to the disadvantage of the english , for all the efforts to revive the anti-french coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with the new king of the romans . these shifts in alliance and allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the english embassy as a whole , but also directly involved the two savoyards , amadee and othon . in spite of the armistice negotiated by amadee two years earlier , the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis of savoy was still going on , and although little is known about it , that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against french expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict . a second truce had been arbitrated in april , 1298 , by jean d'arlay , lord of chalon-sur-saone , the most staunch of edward's burgundian allies , and these last were represented in the discussions at the curia by gautier de montfaucon , othon's neighbor and a member of the vaudois coalition . but although in many of these discussions othon and amadee might have been tempted to consider their own interests as well as those of the king , edward's confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders of the embassy . amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship with the king , but othon , who at sixty seems still to have been a simple knight , merited his position solely by his own character and ability . the younger men , vere , and pembroke , who was also edward's cousin and whose lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that caused edward of carnarvon's irreverent friend , piers gaveston , to nickname him  joseph the jew '' , were relatively new to the game of diplomacy , but pontissara had been on missions to rome before , and hotham , a man of great learning ,  jocund in speech , agreeable to meet , of honest religion , and pleasing in the eyes of all '' , and an archbishop to boot , was as reliable and experienced as othon himself . but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two savoyards were the heads of it , for they were the only ones who were empowered to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably absent . this also gave them the unpleasant duty of being spokesmen for the mission , and they could foresee that that would not be easy . underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert his flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain , the king of france , in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate scots . this was a doubly bitter blow to the king . in the eyes of those who still cared for such things , it was a reflection on his honor , and it gave further grounds for complaint to his overtaxed subjects , who were already grumbling -- although probably not in latin --  non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana '' . bad relations between england and flanders brought hard times to the shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded flemish cities , and while the english , so far , had done no more than grumble , othon had seen what the discontent might lead to , for before he left the low countries the citizens of ghent had risen in protest against the expense of supporting edward and his troops , and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued . in all the talk of feudal rights , the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers , nor was it easy to do so , for all along the road to italy they passed the florentine pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from england and rough flemish cloth , the former to be spun and woven by the arte della lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the arte della calimala with the pigment recently discovered in asia minor by one of their members , bernardo rucellai , the secret of which they jealously kept for themselves . these chatty merchants made amusing and instructive traveling companions , for their business took them to all four corners of the globe , and florentine gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the inferno will prove . a northern ambassador , willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open , could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead at the curia . they had other topics of conversation , besides their news from courts and fairs , which were of interest to othon , the builder of castles in wales and churches in his native country . behind him lay the low countries , where men were still completing the cathedrals that a later florentine would describe as  a malediction of little tabernacles , one on top of the other , with so many pyramids and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all , for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble '' ; ; the low countries , where the middle ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of grandson .

wildlife habitat resources in 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing . hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses . this use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 . the long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment . the wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1 . revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources . 2 . inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other federal agencies and with the states in which national forests and grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including  a  big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of national forests and grasslands ,  b  fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of national forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and  c  participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on national forest lands by states , other federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values . 3 . improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas . 4 . develop wildlife openings , food patches , and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres . 5 . improve 7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks , planting streamside cover , and constructing channel improvements . protection the total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized . they kill and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses . the loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet . if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952 . about 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes . these destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows , and upon the other renewable forest resources . the long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services . this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations . in addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease . protection from insects and disease in the 10-year period , it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period . this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection . the work will consist of : 1 . intensification of present activities through  a  quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks ; ;  b  more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ;  c  quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic . the initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated . 2 . continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production . the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed . 3 . initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites . 4 . coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses . protection from fire it is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands , all critical watersheds , and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads . this will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection . an additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation . meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 . expansion , modernization , and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards . this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use . this will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel . 2 . adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for suppression of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely . 3 . reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas . this work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks . protection from other damage rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents , such as porcupines and mice , on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands . these areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forests . approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period . control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known . roads and trails the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions . this system is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the secretary of commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the secretary of agriculture . both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the national forests . in the forest highway system , there are now 24,400 miles of public roads . these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another . because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties , this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed . it is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests . in the forest development road and trail system , there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails . these roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the national forests . construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture . it is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads , and 80,000 miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , forage , and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis . the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection . it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds . the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as :  a  the protection of forage , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ;  b  the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ;  c  the volume of timber that can be marketed , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ;  d  the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire , windstorm , insects , and disease ; ;  e  the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals . the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible . furthermore , roads that give access to national forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years . use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve . the long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services . for the year 2000 this means servicing  a  the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year ,  b  recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors ,  c  a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and  d  60 million acres of rangelands . service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails , along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails . about 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads . about 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000 . program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1 . complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails . this constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities . approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of national forest timber , but paid for by the government through adjustment of stumpage prices . 2 . provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period . land adjustment , land purchase , land use within the units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular . in some units , national forest ownership is well blocked together . in many others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership . within exterior boundaries of national forests and national grasslands , there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-federal ownership . one consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land , or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land . some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these federal lands . and some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes , are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed . lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern states . the long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national grasslands .

beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps . the thin legs twitched convulsively once , then kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound . the scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands . the child was gone . when juanita awoke , kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief ,  no , no , oh , no ! ! '' they put kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian minister . he sat beside kate's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of god's will , while kate lay staring angrily at him . when he told her god had called the child to him , she rejected his words rebelliously . few of the neighbors came , but mrs. tussle came , called by tragedy .  it always comes in threes '' , she sighed heavily .  trouble never comes but in threes '' . they held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot . kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment . she would not accept the death of such a little child .  god called her to him '' , the minister had said . god would not do that , kate thought stubbornly . jonathan's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from god against both kate and himself . in blind panic of grief she accepted jonathan's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by god . she held jonathan's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed . she had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom . juanita and mrs. tussle kept kate in bed a week until her milk dried . when she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty . she disciplined herself daily to do what must be done . she had even steeled herself to keep juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare kate remembrance of the baby's death . juanita drooped about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which kate attributed to the baby's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to  miss juanita fitzroy '' , bearing a grafton postmark . seeing the slanting hand , kate knew uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel . the federal forces had taken parkersburg and grafton from the rebels and were moving to take all the mountains . kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for juanita . uncle randolph and joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp . joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school . he had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from harpers ferry . kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss . she loved him and missed his company . uncle randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own . what it was kate could not fathom . he claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but kate had not smelled brandy on him since mrs. lattimer's funeral . joel knew what he was about , however .  you're gonna get caught '' , she heard joel say to uncle randolph by the pump one morning .  not this old fox '' , chuckled uncle randolph .  everybody knows i am just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink . i aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure '' .  whiskey still , my foot '' , said joel .  you're back there riding with the guerrillas , the moccasin rangers '' .  hush '' , said uncle randolph , smiling ,  or i will give you another black eye '' . he patted the eye joel had had blackened in a fight over being rebel at the crossroads some days back . kate had no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the river road and hill trails through the nights till dawn . stranger , uncle randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing  old dan tucker '' at the top of his voice . hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober . what he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by general mcclellan , threatening reprisals against rebel guerrillas . she was taken up in worry for the reckless old man . kate drew more and more on her affection for joel through the hot days of summer work . she had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw miss snow crack joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom . kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen joel's burning humiliation before miss snow's cold , bespectacled wrath . he had the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve . these would be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately . she tried to find some way to draw him out , to help him . whenever she found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day . he tended the new colts beau had sired . he helped kate and juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk . no one went much to the crossroads now except uncle randolph . they stayed in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news . jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of harpers ferry before they abandoned it ; ; of their first engagement at falling waters after old jack's first brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the b  o railroad . the men were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as jackson wished . the peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in wheeling , which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors . dangling his gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the rebel losses in the mountains , at cheat and rich mountains both , and the federal march on beverly .  cleaned all them rebs out'n the hills , they did ! ! they will not never git over inter loyal western virginia , them traitors ! ! the federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed . after he had gone , kate asked uncle randolph proudly ,  would you take their oath '' ? ? and the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said ,  hell , yes ! ! i think i have taken it about fifty times already '' ! ! winking at joel's look of shock . her mother wrote kate of her grief at the death of kate's baby and at jonathan's decision to go with the south  and , dear kate '' , she wrote ,  poor dr. breckenridge's son robert is now organizing a militia company to go south , to his good father's sorrow . maj. anderson of fort sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the u.s. army . in spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , john hunt morgan is openly flying the confederate flag over his woolen factory '' ! ! rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley . accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old george down to parkersburg for the news .  all dey know down dere is it were at manassas junction and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them . in the next few days they had cause to rejoice . it had been a big battle , and the confederate forces had won . jonathan and ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing . kate and mrs. tussle waited for letters anxiously . joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate . when kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful . they all prayed now that the north would realize that peace must come , for virginia had defended her land victoriously . the week after manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when she saw the federal soldiers from her upstairs window . they had already lost most of their corn , she thought . were they to be insulted again because of the south's great victory ? ? she remembered mcclellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs . at the landing she saw juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door . juanita stopped just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth . as kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw colonel marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look juanita wore . kate greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit .  what brings you here again , colonel marsh '' ? ? she asked , taking him and juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun .  i stopped to say goodbye , mrs. lattimer , and to tell you how sorry i was to hear about your baby . i wish our doctor could have saved her '' .  it was a terrible loss to me '' , said kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that juanita must have written to him at grafton .  where will you go now that you're leaving parkersburg '' ? ? she asked him , seeing juanita's eyes grow bleak .  as you know , general mcclellan has been occupying beverly . he has notified me that he has orders to go to washington to take over the army of the potomac . i am to go to washington to serve with him '' .  when are you to leave '' ? ? kate asked , watching them both now anxiously . their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .  tomorrow . would you permit juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , mrs. lattimer '' ? ?  stay here in the parlor where it is cool '' , she said , trying to be calm . it would be better for joel and uncle randolph and mrs. tussle not to see them . kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations . then she took iced lemonade to marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden . when marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the river road where the gentians burned blue , juanita was shaken and trying not to cry . she sought kate out upstairs , her lips trembling .  he wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told kate .  what do you want to do '' ? ? kate asked , uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma .  i could go with him . he knows me as your niece , which , of course , i am . but i am a slave ! ! you own me . it is your decision '' , said juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly .  no , the decision is yours . i have held your papers of manumission since i married mr. lattimer '' .
